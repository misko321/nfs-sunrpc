# nfs_sunrpc

## Description

This project is a simple **NFS (Network file system)** server&client, that allows for basic operations of sharing files and directories. It is based upon **SunRPC** for remote method calls, although writtin **C++** instead of pure **C**.

## Usage

### Server

Server is run with one parameter that is the path to a directory that should be served. If no parameter is given, a default of current working directory is applied.

### Client

Client is run with 1 parameter, i.e. the address of the running NFS server. After starting client, a command prompt appears (`>`), that allows for execution of sharing operations. Allowed operations are:

```
//list files of remote directory
> ls

//list files of current local working directory
> lls

// create an empty file on the server
> create <filename>

// create an empty directory on the server
> mkdir <dirname>

// delete a file or directory on the server
> delete <filename/dirname>

//send a file or directory to the server
> send <filename/dirname>

// get a file or directory from the server
> get <filename/dirname>

// exit client program
> exit
> quit
```

## Project file structure
All source code is located under **src/** directories. **\*.x** file contains interface definition as used by **rpcgen**. Thus, files inside **src/** directory represent the same structure as the one generated by **rpcgen**.

## Build

To build the project simply run:
```
$ make
